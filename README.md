# SC1015-Mini-Project

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). The dataset we have chosen is a data analyst job dataset that was scrapped from glassdoors.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs
For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## Problem Definition

- What variables affect the salary of a data analyst

## Models Used

1. Ordinary Least Squares Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. GridSearch CV

## Conclusion

- The larger the company size the more likely it pays better.
- Data analyst with SQL skillset are paid higher in average.
- Data analyst working in the Industry of Consumer Products Manufacturing have a tendency of getting paid lower.
- Data analyst working in the Industry of Electrical & Electronic have a tendency of getting paid higher.
- Data analyst working in companies with a role of manager gets paid higher in annual average salary.

## What did we learn from this project?

- We were able to predict annual average salary with certain variables such as Size, Industry, Type of Job and SQL skillset for job seekers.
- Ordinary Least Squares Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- GridSearch CV
- Wordcloud
